/*
 * This file holds the configuration settings for the Guccho backend. It is advised to use
 * an editor that supports Typescript files for better error detection during editing.
 *
 * Environment Variables Handling:
 * The functions `env()` and `safeEnv()` are used for runtime retrieval of environment variables.
 *
 * - `safeEnv()`: This function fetches environment variables. If a variable is not set, it returns undefined.
 *   You can set a default value using `env(variableName) ?? defaultValue`. For instance, to default
 *   to a local Redis server when REDIS_URL is absent, use `safeEnv('REDIS_URL') ?? 'redis://localhost'`.
 *
 * - `env()`: This is used for mandatory environment variables. The absence of such a variable will
 *   prevent Guccho from launching. This is typically used for essential credentials like database connections.
 *   Example usage: `env('DB_DSN')`.
 *
 * Path Helpers:
 * - `resolve()`: This function is used to convert relative paths into absolute ones. This is important when
 *   starting Guccho from a directory other than the root, as relative paths might otherwise point to incorrect
 *   locations. You can also use an absolute path, which starts with '/' in Linux/Unix or 'C:\\' in Windows.
